You spent hours researching about the best agencies to work with and shortlist a bunch of them. Now you need to finalize the one that will turn your idea into a reality. The next thing you need to do is create a solid project brief and share it with all the shortlisted agencies, to kick off discussions.",

The best way to imaging a project brief, is a document that is read by a complete stranger and she understanding, in entirety, what is it that you’re looking to build. There are certain other things that you need to add, for example, things like timelines and budget constraints to complete it. Software agencies will use your project brief as a basis of scoping out the work and estimating timelines, manpower/skills required, costs associated with the project amongst other things. Hence, writing a comprehensive project brief can save you a lot of time and make the process generally smoother.",
